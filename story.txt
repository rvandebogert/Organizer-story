In Wyoming there once lived a man. This was no ordinary man,
however, he was known to possess a great power. This man's name
was Albert and he was known as the Wyoming Super Human for his amazing
ability to chop off any one of his limbs without perminant damage
(his limbs grow back very slowly, similar to that of a lizard's tail).
The Wyoming Super Human was making a living as a performer at the local 
circus, but he wanted more. What could this strange ability of his
offer him? He had a brilliant idea. He went down to the local hospital
and asked the nurses if he could donate one of his limbs...
A kind nurse affirmed that the hospital would be glad to accept
any and all limbs or apendages. The gentleman from Wyoming was
so ecstatic that he could help those in need that he exclaimed that he was
the reincarnation of Jesus. Albert is a 1000 year old human that draws his power
from the ancient times. Unfortunately for Albert, he was also a loner and
needed to make friends at the hospital. He only wanted to help people at the hospital
so he could be friends with the patients. Albert is still loner to this day.

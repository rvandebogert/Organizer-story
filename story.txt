In Wyoming there once lived a man. This was no ordinary man,
however, he was known to possess a great power. This man's name
was Albert and he was known as the Wyoming Super Human for his amazing
ability to chop off any one of his limbs without perminant damage
(his limbs grow back very slowly, similar to that of a lizard's tail).
The Wyoming Super Human was making a living as a performer at the local 
circus, but he wanted more. What could this strange ability of his
offer him? He had a brilliant idea. He went down to the local hospital
and asked the nurses if he could donate one of his limbs...

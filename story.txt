In Wyoming there once lived a man. This was no ordinary man, however, he was known to possess a great power. This man's name was Albert and he was known as the Wyoming Super Human for his amazing ability to chop off any one of his limbs without perminant damage (his limbs grow back very slowly, similar to that of a lizard's tail).
